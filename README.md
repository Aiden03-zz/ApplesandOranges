# ApplesandOranges
A project I did for my Intro to Java class. Basic programming of a beginner using JOptionPane Dialog Boxes.
In our class, we used NetBeans IDE instead of Eclipse.
If there is any way to improve upon this code or any codes I upload please feel free to comment and offer feedback.
I have completed this class.
